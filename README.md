Chatbot is an artifical agent which is a software program desisgned to communicate with users in text or speech. Its examples are: Alexa,Siri.

Chatbots often perform tasks like making a transaction, booking a hotel, form submissions, etc.

Chatbots are categorised into 2 types: 1) Rule-based 2) Self learning

Rule-based: In this approach, a bot is trained according to rules. Based on this a bot can answer simple queries but sometimes fails to answer complex queries.

Self-learning: it is again divided into 2 categories.

Retrieval based and generative based.

The script is generative based in which the model comes with the answer rather than searching from set of answers.

Dataset is a .txt file which contains information about machine learning.

Chatbpt searches for the appropriate answers to the asked query about machine learning.
