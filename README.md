Chatbot is an artifical agent which is a software program desisgned to communicate with users in text or speech. Its examples are: Alexa,Siri.

Chatbots often perform tasks like making a transaction, booking a hotel, form submissions, etc.

Chatbots are categorised into 2 types: 1) Rule-based 2) Self learning

Rule-based: In this approach, a bot is trained according to rules. Based on this a bot can answer simple queries but sometimes fails to answer complex queries.

Self-learning: it iRemoving Noises again divided into 2 categories.

Retrieval based and generative based.

The script is generative based in which the model comes with the answer rather than searching from set of answers.

Dataset is a .txt file which contains information about machine learning.

Chatbpt searches for the appropriate answers to the asked query about machine learning.

Libraries used: NLTK(Natural Language Toolkit) it is a python library that work with human language data. It is used in text processing for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning.

To install NLTK: pip install NLTK

to import: import NLTK

to downlaod :nltk.download(): to download the packages.

Text preprocessing is done ny NLTK like: Converting the entire text into uppercase or lowercase,Tokenization,Removing Noise,Stemming,Lemmatization.

To rescale the frequency of words TF-IDF approach is used. which means Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency,

TF = (Number of times term t appears in a document)/(Number of terms in the document)

Inverse Document Frequency: is a scoring of how rare the word is across documents.

TF-IDF is a transformation applied to texts to get two real-valued vectors in vector space.

After TF-IDF Cosine similarity is calculated which is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors.
